    Lately I've been feeling like
    <br>My head's up in the clouds
    <br><br>And I know that
    <br>I ain't ever coming back down
    <br><br>Lately I've been feeling like
    <br>I know where to go
    <br><br><em>That special place</em> of you and I
    <br>Baby, that's where thoughts can flow
