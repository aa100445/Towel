    <em><strong>That Special Place</em></strong>
    <br><em>This is the chorus of the song.</em>
  </h3>
  <p>
    Lately I've been feeling like
    <br>My head's up in the clouds
    <br><br>And I know that
    <br>I ain't ever coming back down
    <br><br>Lately I've been feeling like
    <br>I know where to go
    <br><br><em>That special place</em> of you and I
    <br>Baby, that's where thoughts can flow
  </p>

    Poem 1: 
    <em><strong>Short Tester Poem</em></strong>
  </h3>
  <p>
    Roses are red
    <br>Violets are blue
    <br>Sugar is sweet
    <br><em>And so are you!</em>
